HackingEDU-Live
live.html is the site I worked on for HackingEDU -- the site served as a guide for hackers to learn about HackingEDU and provided useful information regarding the hackathon such as bus schedules, prizes, food and wifi information, etc.

live.html can be found in '/public' and the css file can be found under '/public/assets/css' (live_style.css).
